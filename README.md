# servinformacion_test

This is a test for servinformacion .

Hey! I'm Andr√©s Bayona and I'm grateful for the opportunity
This is a flutter developer test for servinformacion. 
I'm happy to say I almost complete all the points of the test, except for the geojson map, where I found a lot of inconvenience with all the widgets y tried, the geojson has a problem where cant be drawn, then I tried another geojson and it doesn't have any problem with the widgets.

The third point was focused on the map from the selected state of the USA and their cities, showing their info and comparing with the other one's cities, you can access it using the search button on the appbar and then selecting the state you want to look.

Development:
Here are the steps of the development. 

-I use the flutter version 2.0.3 cuz I consider it better in stability than the new version of flutter, i manage the package with fvm.

-Then create the project with android studio and start looking for information of google_maps_flutter plugin. When I got it I just start trying new functions of this plugin back up by youtube videos and StackOverflow

-it was a strenuous process but I feel good with the result, like I said before, the most problematic thing was to try to draw the geojson archive on flutter, I spent a few hours trying to solve it, til found another plugin that can show the map with a png image and complete the "objective" of the point, i know we have to use this geojson but with more time i can resolve it.

-Finally, I focused on improving the design and fix some overflow bugs, the are still a few bugs but for time reasons I cant fix them.
Thankyou again for the opportunity and i spect this application meet the expectations.
